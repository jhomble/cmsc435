        <div class="row">
            <h4>Usage should be mostly obvious but a few important notes: </h4>
            <h4>1) A user cannot click on an elevator button unless it has already been requested. If you can't click the buttons, check that you first requested the elevator.</h4>
            <h4>2) Average Passenger Wait Time only accounts for time waiting for an elevator to come after a floor button press. It will not be affected by time spent in an elevator.</h4>
            <h4>3) It could take almost a minute for an elevator to answer a call depending on the current volume of traffic. This is not a bug, just how the AVW elevators really work.</h4>
            <h4>4) Clicking on a floor button multiple times will increase the number of people waiting for the elevator in that direction (Yes, we know that isn't how the elevators really work but it is much easier for the user to enter).</h4>

            <h2>How it Works</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4> This simulator uses an HTML front-end utilizing the AngularJS framework to communicate with the JS logic. </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>1) Elevators in AVW use the FS algorithm described in "Algorithms."</h4>
            <h4>2) Users actually exit the elevators at the floor they request (hence the button freeze).</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>Our implementation uses the "Nearest Car" algorithm explained here (page 3):</h4>

            <h2>Verification</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>Through our testing of the AVW elevators, we found an average wait time of approximately 27.3 seconds. This includes testing at both on and off hours. Through multiple test runs of our system, we have achieved an average wait time for passengers of approximately FILL IN NUMBER HERE. While not perfect, we believe this is accurate enough to provide users with valuable information regarding the flow of people through the AVW elevators.</h4>
